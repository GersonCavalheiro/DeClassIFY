- **Validation Strategy:** The approach used to validate the research, e.g., Pilot, Case Study, etc.
- **Data Nature:**  The type of data used, such as Cross-Sectional, Longitudinal, Qualitative or Quantitative.
- **Environment:** The context in which the research was conducted, e.g., In Vitro, In Vivo, Real World, Simulated.
- **Methodological:**  The type of methodology employed, including aspects like Control Model, Historical Analysis, or Modeling.
- **Proof:** The type of logical proof employed, e.g., Abduction, Deduction or Induction.
- **Purpose:** The main objective of the research, e.g. Behavioral or Design Science
- **Secondary Proof:** The type of secondary proof employed, e.g. Proof or Rebuttal
- **Validation Result:** The outcome of validation, e.g. Effectiveness, Cost Effectiveness, etc.
